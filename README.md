# QCX-SSB: SSB with your QCX transceiver (modification)
This is a simple and experimental modification that transforms a [QCX] into a (Class-E driven) SSB transceiver. It can be used to make QRP SSB contacts, or (in combination with a PC) used for the digital modes such as FT8. It can be fully-continuous tuned through bands 160m-10m in the LSB/USB-modes with a 2200Hz bandwidth has up to 5W PEP SSB output and features a software-based full Break-In VOX for fast RX/TX switching in voice and digital operations.

The SSB transmit-stage is implemented completely in a digital and software-based manner: at the heart the 
ATMEGA328P is sampling the input-audio and reconstructing a SSB-signal by controlling the SI5351 PLL phase (through tiny frequency changes over 800kbit/s I2C) and controlling the PA Power (through PWM on the key-shaping circuit). In this way a highly power-efficient class-E driven SSB-signal can be realized; a PWM driven class-E design keeps the SSB transceiver simple, tiny, cool, power-efficient and low-cost (ie. no need for power-inefficient and complex linear amplifier with bulky heat-sink as often is seen in SSB transceivers).

An Open Source Arduino sketch is used as the basis for the firmware, the hardware modification bypasses the QCX CW filter and adds a microphone input in-place of the DVM-circuit; the mod is easy to apply and consist of four wire and four component changes and after applying the transceiver remains compatible with the original QCX (CW) firmware.

This experiment is created to try out what can be done with minimal hardware; a simple ATMEGA processor, a QCX and a software-based SSB processing approach. It would be nice to add more features to the sketch, and try out if the QCX design can be further simplified e.g. by implementing parts of the receiver stage in software. Feel free to experiment with this sketch, let me know your thoughts or contribute here: https://github.com/threeme3/QCX-SSB  There is a forum discussion on the topic here: [QRPLabs Forum]

## Operation:
Currently, the following functions have been assigned to the buttons:

| Button              | Function                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| LEFT single-press   | LSB/USB-mode                                            | 
| LEFT double-press   | reserved                                                |
| LEFT long-press     | VOX mode (for full-break-in or digital modes)           |
| CENTER single-press | Select (smaller) frequency step                         |
| CENTER double-press | Select Band                                             |
| CENTER long-press   | Select (larger) frequency step                          |
| CENTER turn         | Tune frequency                                          |
| RIGHT single-press  | Set amplitude drive level on (8=constant carrier on TX) |
| RIGHT double-press  | (experimental!) Internal calibration of PA amplitude    |

| KEY                 | Transmitter-keyed (PTT)                                 |

Operating Instructions:

Tuning can be done by turning the rotary encoder. Its step size can be decreased or increased by a short or long press. A change of band can be done with a double press. The mode of operation is altered with a short press on the left button; this can be combined with changing S4 to change between wide-band (SSB) and small-band operation operation.

For SSB voice operation, adjust the amplitude drive by pressing right button to a level where voice peaks providing maximum power output (not more than that); this provides an acceptable IMD with good intelligability for local and normal distant operations. In cases where your signal is too weak, set the drive level to 8 to increase the average power output by using a constant amplitude-envelope; in some cases this might be just enough to put your signal above the noise-floor and make yourselve heard; note that this operation degrades the IMD considerably, but since this does not impact the intelligability and since these inter-modulation products are anyway below the noise-floor (and BW limited) they are not in the way, ie. they are not observable by the other station. For long duration QSOs on a specific frequency you can stop holding the PTT by enter (or leave) VOX mode with a long press on left button.

For FT8 (and any other digital) operation, select one of the pre-programmed FT8 bands by double press the rotary encoder, connect the headphone jack to sound card microphone jack, sound card speaker jack to microphone jack, and give a long press on left button to enter VOX mode. Adjust the sound card speaker volume to a minimum and start your favorite FT8 application (JTDX for instance).

To experiment with amplitude pre-distortion algorithm, double-press right button to train the PA amplitude characteristic. This sweeps the amplitude from maximum PWM to minimum PWM and measures the PA response through an internal receiver loopback and stores the values into volatile memory. Once trained, set the appropriate amplitude drive level for voice input. Pre-distorted amplitude response can be measured with a storage spectrum-analyser and a long-press of right button; it will sweep the pre-distorted amplitude from 0 to 100% in 255 steps, where each step has a 10Hz frequency offset.


## Technical Description:
For SSB reception the QCX CW filter is too small, therefore the first modification step 1 is to bypass the CW filter, providing a 3dB wideband passthrough of about 2kHz, this has side-effect that we loose 18dB audio-gain of the CW filter. Another way is to modify the CW-filter <sup>[2](#note2)</sup>, but this creates a steep filter-transition band. Insertion of a SPDT switch between the CW filter output, unfiltered output and the audio amplifier input may support CW and SSB mode selection. The phase-network is less efficient for the full SSB bandwidth in attenuating the unwanted side band, but overall a rejection of ~20 dB can still be achieved. LSB/USB mode switching is done by changing the 90 degree phase shift on the CLK1/CLK2 signals of the SI5351 PLL.

For SSB transmission the QCX DVM-circuitry is changed and used as an audio-input circuit (installation steps 2-5). An electret-microphone (with PTT switch) is added to the Paddle jack connecting the DVM-circuitry, whereby the DOT input acts as the PTT and the DASH input acts as the audio-input (installation step 7). The electret microphone is biased with 5V through a 10K resistor. A 10nF blocking capacitor prevents RF leakage into the circuit. The audio is fed into ADC2 input of the ATMEGA328P microprocessor through a 220nF decoupling capacitor. The ADC2 input is biased at 0.55V via a divider network of 10K to a 1.1V analog reference voltage, with 10-bits ADC resolution this means the microphone-input sensitivity is about 1mV (1.1V/1024) which is just sufficient to process unamplified speech.

A new QCX-SSB firmware is uploaded to the ATMEGA328P (installation step 8), and facilitates a [digital SSB generation technique] in a completely software-based manner. A DSP algorithm samples the ADC2 audio-input at a rate of 4400 samples/s, performs a Hilbert transformation and determines the phase and amplitude of the complex-signal; the phase-changes are restricted<sup>[4](#note4)</sup> and transformed into either positive (for USB) or negative (for LSB) phase changes which in turn transformed into temporary frequency changes which are sent 4400 times per second over 800kbit/s I2C towards the SI5351 PLL. This result in phase changes on the SSB carrier signal and delivers a SSB-signal with a bandwidth of 2200 Hz whereby spurious in the opposite side-band components is attenuated. 

The amplitude of the complex-signal controls the supply-voltage of the PA, and thus the envelope of the SSB-signal. The key-shaping circuit is controlled with a 32kHz PWM signal, which can control the PA voltage from 0 to about 12V in 256 steps, providing a dynamic range of (log2(256) * 6 =) 48dB in the SSB signal. C31 is removed (installation step 6) to ensure that Q6 is operating as a digital switch, this improves the efficiency, thermal stability, linearity, dynamic range and response-time. Though the amplitude information is not mandatory to make a SSB signal intelligable, adding amplitude information improves quality. The complex-amplitude is also used in VOX-mode to determine when RX and TX transitions are supposed to be made.

The IMD performance is related dependent on the quality of the system: the linearity (accuracy) of the amplitude and phase response and the precision (dynamic range) of these quantities. Especially the DSP bit-width, the precision used in the DSP algorithms, the PWM and key-shaping circuit that supplies the PA and the PA phase response are critical. Decreasing (or removing) C32 improves the IMD characteristics but at the cost of an increase of PWM products around the carrier. The following has been done to improve the quality (since R1.01): A. use a more accurate I/Q amplitude estimation algorithm; B. pre-distort, cancel out PA induced amplitude, the SSB generation algorithm applies a amplitude correction through a (amplitude) lookup in a predefined table before modulating. The following planned improvements are still to be done: C. to pre-distort, cancel out PA induced (amplitude-dependent) phase-errors (an experimental phase measurement algorithm can be found in here [commit phase-measurement-experiment]).


## Results
Several OMs reported a successful QCX-SSB modification and were able to make SSB QRP DX contacts over thousands of kilometers on the 20m and 40m bands. During CQ WW contest I was able to make 34 random QSOs on 40m with 5W and an inverted-V over the house in just a few hours with CN3A as my furthest contact, I could observe the benefits of using SSB with constant-envelope in cases where my signal was weak; for FT8 a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with JTDX was used to make FT8 contacts all the way up to NA.

Known issues:
- R1.00: Audio quality especially in a local QSO setup with this release was a bit of a challenge due to analog operation of Q6, resulting in degraded IMD and thermal instability; this issue has been resolved by changing C31/C32 and together with the more accurate signal processing of the new firmware, the IMD performance, carrier+side-band rejection and spectral purity has been improved considerably. **(RESOLVED)**
- R1.01: When transmitting, some distorted audio can be heard from the headphones. This is because the audio op-amps do share same 12V supply as the PA, resulting in serious amplitude RFI. Adding a (>>100uF/16V) capacitor from the Emitter of Q6 to GND alliviate the issue but does not completely resolve. There can be also some RFI into the microphone input, in this case it is recommended to increase MIC_ATTEN value in the code where a value increment represents a 6dB attenuation. 

Measurements:
The following performance measurements were made with QCX-SSB R1.01, a modified RTL-SDR, Spektrum-SVmod-v0.19, Sweex 5.0 USB Audio device and Audicity player. It is recognized that this measurement setup has its own limitations, hence the dynamic range of the measurements is somewhat limited by the RTL-SDR as this device goes easily into overload. Measurements were made with the following setttings: USB modulation, no pre-distortion, two-tone input 1000Hz/1200Hz where audio level is set just before the point where compression starts. Results:
- Intermodulation distortion products (two-tone; SSB with varying  envelope) IMD3, IMD5, IMD7: respectively -30dBc; -33dBc; -36dBc
- Intermodulation distortion products (two-tone; SSB with constant envelope) IMD3, IMD5, IMD7: respectively -13dBc; -13dBc; -16dBc
- Opposite side-band rejection (two-tone): better than -45dBc
- Carrier rejection (two-tone): better than -45dBc
- Wide-band spurious (two-tone): better than -45dBc
- 3dB bandwidth (sweep): 400..2130Hz

### Notes:
1. <a name="note1"/>on a new kit components IC8, IC9, R28-R35, C13-C20, C53 may be omitted if the CW filter is bypassed permanently
2. <a name="note2"/>optionally (not recommended) a steep 2 kHz SSB filter with gain can be realized by modification of Sallen-Key CW filter: replace C13, C15, C17 with 1nF capacitor and remove C53
3. <a name="note3"/>to support si5351 multi-band operation, the RX BPF can be omitted (C1, C5, C8, secondary 3 of T1), and a switchable LPF-bank/matching-network may be placed instead of the existing LPF C25-C28, L1-L3 and matching network C29, C30, L4. The Arduino sketch may be extended to make I2C controllable filter-bank. When using external filters the on-board LPF may be bypassed with a wire.
4. <a name="note4"/>The occupied SSB bandwidth can be further reduced by restricting the maximum phase change (set MAX_DP to half a unit-circle _UA/2 (equivalent to 180 degrees)). The sensitivity of the VOX switching can be set with parameter VOX_THRESHOLD. Audio-input can be attenuated by increasing parameter MIC_ATTEN (6dB per step).
5. <a name="note5"/>In case the ATMEGA328P chip cannot be exchanged you may proceed with ISP programming the QCX via Uno and overwrite the existing firmware: to do so, upload the [ArduinoISP] sketch to Uno, connect Arduino Uno to QCX via [ISP jumper], power on QCX, in Arduino select "Tools > Programmer > Arduino as ISP", select "Tools > Board > Arduino/Genuino Uno", and upload [QCX-SSB Sketch] to QCX by selecting "Sketch > Upload Using Programmer". Once upload succeeds the LCD should display "QCX-SSB". Note that you must disconnect the Microphone in order to use the ISCP/ISP upload facility.
